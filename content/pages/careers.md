          Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I am a licensed Chemical Engineer
          turned Data Analyst with a passion for making sense of complex data
          and identifying trends to help drive informed decisions.


          Before venturing into the world of data, I worked as a Quality
          Assurance Analyst, where I developed a keen eye for detail and a love
          for optimizing processes. As a Chemical Engineer, I have a natural
          tendency to approach problems analytically and methodically, a habit
          that has translated seamlessly into my current role as a Data Analyst.


          In addition to my professional experience, I also have some quirky
          habits that are characteristic of both a Chemical Engineer and a Data
          Analyst. I have a penchant for keeping my workspace neat and
          organized, and I’m not afraid to experiment and try new things to see
          what works best. I also have a love for all things data-related,
          whether it’s digging through datasets or creating beautiful
          visualizations.


          Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit more about me. I am
          excited to continue exploring the world of data and applying my skills
          to help organizations make data-driven decisions.
